A RedLetterMedia Video Picker

Small, simple project meant to help me dust off my web dev skills.  
Mobile first design.  
No frameworks or theme kits, just html/css/vanillaJS.  
No ads/donation links  
All Credit for the video content to https://www.redlettermedia.com/ | https://www.youtube.com/RedLetterMedia

Also diving into cloudformation/s3/cloudfront for deployment and hosting.

## Scripts
`npm run dev` - starts `webpack --watch`, i use VSCode with live server for dev, this sometimes requires a second refresh to catch the build result  
`npm run build` - webpack build, nothing fancy here

## TODO
- ~~add webpack for minification/compilation~~
- ~~more elegant method for getting the episode data into the browser~~
- cloudformation templates
- deployment automation
- add filtering to video picker (e.g. pick a random halloween best of the worst episode)
