A RedLetterMedia Video Picker

Small, simple project meant to help me dust off my web dev skills.  
No frameworks or theme kits, just html/css/vanillaJS.  

Also diving into cloudformation/s3/cloudfront for deployment and hosting.

## TODO
- cloudformation templates
- deployment automation
- add filtering to video picker (e.g. pick a random halloween best of the worst episode)
- more elegant method for getting the episode data into the browser
